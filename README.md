## My modifications:

- I have added fancy lights and shadows from the ggez shadows example
- Minor asthetic changes: color, size and shape of som of the meshes
- Addad a background image
- Fixed creating new mesh every frame, as TanTan said at the end of the video
- Added super simple computer player 2, uncomment line 440-450 to disable
